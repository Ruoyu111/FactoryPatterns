Head First Design Patterns - Chapter 4 - The Factory Pattern

**The Factory Method Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

**The Abstract Factory Pattern** provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## OO Principles
- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
